We’ll explore the “college
scorecard,” a data set assembled by the US Department of Education about post-
secondary (i.e., after high school) educational programs. The college scorecard
allows us to see what programs schools offer, how many students they admit, what
those students pay in tuition and fees, how many students graduate, and how much
they can expect to earn after graduation. From looking at this data, we can better
understand many different aspects of university education in the United States. I
should add that with a data set this large and rich, there are many different ques-
tions that you could ask. After you finish answering the questions I pose here, I
strongly suggest that you also explore the data set on your own, asking (and answer-
ing) questions that you think are interesting and relevant.
